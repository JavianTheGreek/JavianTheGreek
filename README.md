<p>
  My skill set and eagerness to learn reveal a lot about me. As I progressed through education, my interest in frontend development grew. I've been learning front-end web programming for about a year by developing projects and researching best practices. I've created projects that showcase my front-end talents.During my academic years, I also worked on projects in C/C++, Java (OPP), Database Design (SQL), and Web Development (Html, Css, Javascript).<br />
 I'm willing to do a project for any intership or any open source projects :)
