  My skill set and eagerness to learn reveal a lot about me. As I progressed through education, my interest in frontend development grew. For almost two years, I've been studying front-end web programming by creating projects and researching best practices. I've made projects to show off my front-end skills.

  During my academic years, I also worked on projects in C/C++, Java (OPP), <br />Â Database Design (SQL), and Web Development (Html, Css, Javascript).
