  My skill set and eagerness to learn reveal a lot about me. As I progressed through education, my interest in frontend development grew. I've been learning front-end web programming for about a year by developing projects and researching best practices. I've created projects that showcase my front-end talents.

<p align="center">
  During my academic years, I also worked on projects in C/C++, Java (OPP), <br />Â Database Design (SQL), and Web Development (Html, Css, Javascript).
  <br />
  I'm willing to do a 24 hour project for any intership or any side projects :)
