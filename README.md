  My skill set and thirst for learning convey a lot about me. My interest in frontend development has grown as I have attended university. I've been learning front-end   web programming for over two years by developing projects and researching best practices. I've created projects to demonstrate my front-end abilities.

  During my time at university, I also wrote projects in C/C++, Java (OPP), <br /> Database Design (SQL), and Web Development (Html, Css, Javascript).
